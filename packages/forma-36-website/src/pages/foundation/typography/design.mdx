Typography is much more than choosing pretty fonts, itâ€™s a very important components in UI design, Good typography establishes a strong, cohesive visual hierarchy that helps to present content clearly and efficiently to users.

<br />

## Typeface
Forma strives for a performant, clean experience to our users, hence, we chose our font stack to match the system fonts that already comes preloaded with the OS on your device.
These are the font stack we use in our systems...

![Typefaces demonstration, San Francisco, Lucida Grande, Neue Helvetica, Arial, and Segoe UI](./assets/typeface.png)

Our font family consists of different font types, it is known as *system fonts* each operating system comes with a default font.

**San Francisco** appears on Safari (Mac OS X and iOS); **Neue Helvetica** and **Lucida Grande** appears on older versions of Mac OS X; **Segoe UI** targets Windows and Windows phone; **Arial** is available on almost all operating systems.

<br />

### Consistency
![Line-height demonstration against 4px grid](./assets/line-height.png)

To ensure each font type is represented properly, and the customer experience stays the same across different devices, all font family members are tested against the 4px grid.

When fonts are stacked on top of each other, line height acts as a wrapper around different font sizes and weights. 
This garantees the experience doesn't change when different fonts are presented.

<br />

## Font sizes
Instead of using fixed sizes with **px** units, our type system uses **rem** units. **REMs** are an approach to set font sizes based on a *single* font size of the root element **(html)**

This gives us flexibility to scale up/down elements for different screen sizes from one single source of truth.

### REMs and Accessibility
REMs plays an important role in accessibility, when users change the default font size *(16px)* of the browser, REMs kicks in, and simply your project will scale up based on user's font size choice.

## Guidelines

### Use Forma36 Sizes

Don't define your own text sizes, use the available text styles from the sketch UI Kit. This ensures consistency across our solutions.

### Color Contrast

[WCAG 2.1 Contrast Guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum) recommends to have at least 4.5:1 contrast between your text color, and the background. 
Low color contrast may result indistinguishable elements on your screen, especially for people with color blindness.
