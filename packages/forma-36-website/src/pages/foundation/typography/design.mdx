Typography is much more than choosing pretty fonts, itâ€™s a very important components in UI design, Good typography establishes a strong, cohesive visual hierarchy that helps to present content clearly and efficiently to users.

<br />

## Typeface
Forma strives for a performant, clean experience to our users, hence, 
we chose our font stack to match the system fonts that comes preloaded with the OS on your device.

These are the font family we use in our systems...

Our font family consists of different font types, they are known as *system fonts*, 
every operating system comes with at least one default font...

**San Francisco** appears on Safari (Mac OS X and iOS); **Neue Helvetica** and **Lucida Grande** appears on older versions of Mac OS X; 
**Segoe UI** targets Windows and Windows phone; **Arial** is available on almost all operating systems.

<br />

## Font sizes
Pixels units maintainence is rigid. Hence, we use *REM* units to define our font sizes.

### What are REMs?
REMs (root em) are simply a ratio of the root element font size. The root element here is the browser default font size 16px. (1rem = 16px) (2rem = 32px)

Using rem units enables our system to scale up/down based on user's prefrence.


<br />

### Available Sizes

<br />
<SectionHeading>Section Heading</SectionHeading>

*Section Heading* addresses the small blocks that requires extra context, to make it easier for audience to understand.

Font size: **12px** - Line Height: **18px** - Weight: **600**

<br />

<Paragraph>Body</Paragraph>

*Body* is the base font size for content. Used usually for paragraphs.

Font size: **14px** - Line Height: **21px** - Weight: **500**

<br />

<Subheading>Subheading</Subheading>

*Subheadings* are headings for nested blocks within your sections; Assuming you have a section with heading "Contact us", you want to group "Address" related elements in a block, that when *Subheading* comes in handy.

 Font size: **16px** - Line Height: **24px** - Weight: **700**

<br />

<Heading>Heading</Heading>

*Heading* is used to define sections in your solution, this is **cruical** for accessibility; Headings are used to define sections/blocks in your page, it guides users through your page/view.

Similarly visually impaired people use screen readers, and screen readers find sections in your page/view based on your heading hierarchy.

Font size: **21px** - Line Height: **31px** - Weight: **700**

<br />

<DisplayText>Display</DisplayText>

Use *Display* on similar cases as Display Text Large.

Font size: **28px** - Line Height: **35px** - Weight: **700**

<br />

<DisplayText size='large'>Display Large</DisplayText>

*Display Large* is used to display text in special scenarios - use Display Text Large on empty states, promotional/featured items, etc.

*Display Large* should not be used as a replacement for headings/page titles (use the Heading styles instead).

Font size: **35px** - Line Height: **44px** - Weight: **700**

<br />

### Line height

Line height are basically verticle wrappers around letters on each line. 

Our line height is also defined based on **rem**, this forces the line height to correspond to the root font size as well.


### Consistency
![Line-height demonstration against 4px grid](./assets/line-height.png)

To ensure each font type is represented properly, and the customer experience stays the same across different devices, 
each font family members falls under the 4px base line grid.

Now when different font types, sizes, and weights are stacked together, our typography system adapts flawlessly.

## Guidelines

### Use Forma36 Sizes

Don't define your own text sizes, use the available text styles from the sketch UI Kit. This ensures consistency across our solutions.

### Color Contrast

[WCAG 2.1 Contrast Guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum) recommends to have at least 4.5:1 contrast between your text color, and the background. 
Low color contrast may result indistinguishable elements on your screen, especially for people with color blindness.
