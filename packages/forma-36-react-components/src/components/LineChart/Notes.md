This chart uses `echart` which will be loaded on demand and not impact initial bundle size.

Look in the [echart documentation](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-doc/public/en/option.html) for configuration options.
Our default are different from the `echart` documentation, but can be overwritten.

Caveats: Changing dimensions after initial render won't work.
