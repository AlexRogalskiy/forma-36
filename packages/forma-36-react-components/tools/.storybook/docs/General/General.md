# General

This section contains general information about the component library we use at Contentful. The component library is the single source of truth we reference when designing or adding UI.

The component library is split into the following sections:

## Documentation

A place for general documentation about the component library.

## Tokens

Design tokens are the granular values we use when designing and implementing UI. Tokens include things such as font-sizes and colours. In this section we share values for designers and engineers, and a visual reference of each value.

## Components

React components available for immediate use.

## Blueprints

Components we have identified but are not yet available within the component library. These serve as design notes to those wanting to add components to the component library.
